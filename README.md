## 1. Title: JavaScript Quiz
## 2. App Description
This code will generate a "JavaScript quizs". A user will be given 60 seconds for 10 questions. If incorrect answer is submitted, a 10 second will be deducted from the remaining time. When a user click the "Start/Restart" button, the test will begin. For each question, a user should select an answer and click "Next" button. 
If nothing is selected and clicked "Next" button, a alert message will be shown: 
* _"Please choose an answer!"._

A user can move to a previous question clicking "Prev" button. Once the test is finished, the final score will be shown. Then, a user can save his/her information (i.e., initial), then the final score will be displayed with his/her initial again.

A user can take the exam again from the beginning as clicking "Start/Restart Quiz" button whenever you want. 

## 3. Source Code Description
This code includes following codes:
* _indexv7.html (v7): main HTML file_ 
* _style.css (v7): CSS style sheet_
